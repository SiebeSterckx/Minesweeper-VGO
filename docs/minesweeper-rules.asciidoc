# Minesweeper Rules

In short, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)[Minesweeper]:

* It's a single player game.
* It is played on a board divided into squares, typically 9&times;9, 16&times;16 or 30&times;16 large.
* Each square can contain a bomb.
* Each square shows how many bombs are in the 8 squares adjacent to it.
* The player can mark a square that they suspect contains a bomb.
* The player uncovers the number or bomb when the square is clicked on.
* You lose when you uncover a bomb.
* You win when the whole board is uncovered except the mines.

An optional rule introduced _flooding_:

* When the player uncovers a square with 0 adjacent bombs, the board will uncover all adjacent squares recursively.
